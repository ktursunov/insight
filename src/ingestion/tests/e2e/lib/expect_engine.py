"""Evaluate `expect` rules against a batch response.

Implements `cpt-bronze-to-api-e2e-algo-yaml-eval-expect`
(DoD `cpt-bronze-to-api-e2e-dod-yaml-expect-engine`).

Each rule:
  in:     select the batch result by request id (omit when one query)
  find:   exact field-equality selector → exactly one row of result.items (binds `it`)
  then ONE of:
    equal:  subset equality on the matched row (explicit null supported)
    assert: CEL boolean over bindings `it`, `items`, `result`, `results`, `status`

`find` is intentionally exact-equality only — anything richer (inequalities,
counts, predicates) is expressed in a CEL `assert`, so the rig does not carry a
second selector mini-language (CEL is already the assertion language).

No-unasserted-stat rule
------------------------
A bullet row the API returns carries up to six stat fields:
`value, median, range_min, range_max, p25, p75` (there is no `p50` — the 50th
percentile is returned as `median`). Within one `case`, every `find`-matched row
that CARRIES a stat field MUST have that field asserted — either by an `equal`
key or by referencing it in a CEL `assert` on the same row — otherwise this
module raises `ExpectError`. This stops a fixture from silently ignoring a stat
the API returns (e.g. asserting `value`/`median` but forgetting `p25`/`p75`).

The rule is self-scoping: a stat field ABSENT from the row is never required, so
a row that legitimately returns only `value`/`median`/`range_*` passes without a
`p25`/`p75` assertion. Empty-window cases (a `find` that matches 0 rows binds no
`it`) are naturally exempt. The gate runs AFTER all explicit rules pass, so the
existing first-explicit-failure semantics are preserved.
