"""Guard: prove the seed-once namespacing keeps every fixture's data disjoint.

In seed-once mode all fixtures' bronze coexists in one ClickHouse. Correctness
hinges on `lib.namespace` making each fixture's identity unique so that (a)
ReplacingMergeTree never collapses two fixtures' rows into one, and (b) no query
sees a neighbour's data. This test asserts that invariant WITHOUT a database, so
a namespacing regression (or a new fixture/table that dodges the rules) fails
fast in CI before the stack is ever built.

The load-bearing check derives each bronze table's REAL `ORDER BY` key from the
placeholder DDL (`create-bronze-placeholders.sh` — the same schema the rig
seeds into) and asserts that, after namespacing, no two fixtures share a key
tuple for the same table. That is exactly the RMT merge key, so a pass proves no
cross-fixture collapse is possible. (This is the check that would have caught
`bronze_bamboohr.employees ORDER BY id` / `bronze_jira.jira_issue ORDER BY id`
sharing the literal `id`s `e001` / `TDW-1` across fixtures.)
