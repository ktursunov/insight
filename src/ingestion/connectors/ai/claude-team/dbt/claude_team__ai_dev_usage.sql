-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Claude Team per-user per-day CC usage → class_ai_dev_usage
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_team.claude_team_code_metrics — daily aggregate stream
-- pulled via the customer-deployed claude-team-proxy from the claude.ai
-- web API (/api/organizations/{org_id}/claude_code/metrics). One row per
-- (email, metric_date) — metrics already aggregated to daily grain by the API.
--
-- Filters:
--   status = 'active'             — drop deactivated seats (per PR #553)
--   email IS NOT NULL / != ''     — rows without email cannot be attributed
--   metric_date IS NOT NULL       — guard against phantom 1970-01-01 rows
--
-- session_count: `total_sessions`. DQ note: 5/34 sample users had
--   sessions=0 while lines_accepted>0 — headless / `cc -p` invocations are
--   excluded from the session counter by Anthropic. Not a model bug.
--
-- lines_added: `total_lines_accepted` — AI-accepted lines. Same semantics as
--   Enterprise `code_lines_added`. Total keystrokes not available → NULL.
--
-- cost_cents: `total_cost` (decimal-as-string, e.g. "1.23") cast to cents.
--   Claude Team is the first per-user-per-day cost source in Silver; all
--   other sources expose cost at org/workspace grain only.
--
-- prs_with_cc_count / prs_total_count: Anthropic GitHub-app attribution.
--   Populated only on tenants with the app connected; zero on orgs without it.
--   ⚠️ prs_total_count may be a period-aggregate (cumulative), not daily —
--   verify against a tenant with a connected GitHub app.
