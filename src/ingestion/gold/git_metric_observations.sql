-- Source measure observations for the unified metrics runtime, git family.
-- Reads class contracts only; no vendor-specific columns or tool names may
-- appear inline. Every measure is emitted through the shape macros in
-- macros/metric_observation_measures.sql; file classification and the
-- source-dimension display label come from macros/git_file_category.sql
-- (static product vocabulary, computed here rather than in silver so
-- taxonomy/label changes apply retroactively on the next build).
--
-- Materialized as a sorted table: the observation pipeline below (FINAL
-- dedup, joins, measure branches) runs once per dbt build — which is
-- also the only time the silver inputs can have changed — instead of once
-- per metric query. The ordering key mirrors the runtime's filter shape
-- (source_key, measure_key, entity_id, metric_date), so single-measure
-- queries read index-pruned ranges rather than the whole relation.
--
-- query_settings bound the CREATE-AS-SELECT for every runner: an
-- over-limit build spills aggregation/sort state to disk instead of
-- failing on the server memory tracker.
--
-- Grain per measure:
--   day-grain sums:  commit_count, code_lines_added, lines_added,
--                    lines_removed, pr_created, pr_merged
--   day-grain presence: commit_day
--   event-grain (one row per source event, feeding median metrics):
--                    commit_change_size (per non-merge commit),
--                    pr_cycle_hours (per merged pull request),
--                    pr_change_size (per pull request)
--
-- Attribution:
--   Commits and file changes attribute by the commit author_email.
--   Pull requests resolve in tiers, never guessing: the PR's own
--   author_email when present; else the dominant author_email among the
--   PR's linked commits (tie -> unresolved). Rows that resolve to no
--   email are excluded — honest absence, never a name-matched guess.
--
-- Dating:
--   pr_created anchors at created_on. pr_merged and pr_cycle_hours anchor
--   at closed_on gated on state MERGED: the sources set the close
--   timestamp to (or coalesce it with) the merge timestamp for merged
--   pull requests, and a merge-commit join would risk fan-out for
--   marginal precision. Negative durations (dirty close timestamps) are
--   excluded from cycle hours.
--
-- Merge commits are excluded once in commits_source; the exclusion
-- propagates to file-change measures through the authorship join.
-- `LIMIT 1 BY` collapses the same commit hash appearing in more than one
-- repo of a source (forks), keeping commit_count a distinct-hash count.
--
-- Memory shape (the measure branches run as concurrent pipelines within
-- the build query): FINAL is the cheapest dedup here — a streaming merge
-- of sorted parts — and stays wherever dedup is needed. Version-ordered
-- `ORDER BY .. LIMIT 1 BY` is not an alternative: it buffers a full sort
-- of the read (measured ~2x the memory of FINAL at scale). The two reads
-- that avoid FINAL do so because they need no dedup at all: the identity
-- vote in pr_commit_emails aggregates by uniqExact, which duplicate row
-- versions cannot inflate. file_changes pre-aggregates to commit x category
-- grain before joining, so per-file rows and file_path strings never enter
-- a join side or a measure aggregation.
