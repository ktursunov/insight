"""Emit the per-language CI matrix of the components a PR touches, as JSON, for
the GitHub Actions `changes` job. Sources the component↔path map and the
per-component collection params from components.py (the shared registry) — so no
globs are duplicated in YAML and there is one source of truth. Runs no tests.

Usage: python3 scripts/ci/changed.py [--all]
Output: {"rust": [<entry>...], "dotnet": [...], "python": [...]}

        (a crate may be lint-only); dotnet carries solution + cover (a component
        may be test-only, e.g. identity); python carries cov_package.
