"""
Demo persons + team profiles.

The 25-person organisation that the seed script populates: one CEO
above 4 team leads (development, sales, HR, support), each with 5 ICs.
The development-team lead's email is `DEV_USER_EMAIL`; the other 24
persons get deterministic `email_<team>_<NN>@company.nonpresent`
addresses.

A 26th person, the ADMIN OPERATOR, is in the roster but not in the
organisation: no team, no place in the org chart, no activity. It exists
so the admin-gated API surface has a caller, and it is kept outside the
org so that granting it cannot move a single metric or change what any
other person can see. See `build_roster`.

`TEAM_PROFILES` below maps a per-team source-type to a numeric
multiplier (0 = no rows; 1 = baseline; >1 = heavier). The row
generators consult these weights to decide which silver rows a given
person produces and at what volume.
