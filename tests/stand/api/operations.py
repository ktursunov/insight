"""Every operation the stand serves behind the gateway, named once.

Read from the route tables in
`src/backend/services/{analytics,identity-resolution}/src/api/`, not from the
committed OpenAPI documents — the identity one is still the .NET contract and
is stale in both directions (it declares `/v1/persons/{email}`, which identity
answers 404 for and analytics actually serves; it omits both persons-sync
operations; and every operation in it lists only `200`).

Two consumers, and the reason this is one list rather than two:

* `test_gateway.py` asserts 401 for EVERY row. That is the deployed-path
  assertion the in-process rig cannot make, since auth is disabled there.
* the per-service modules assert what each operation does WITH a session.

A 401 alone proves nothing — the gateway rejects at the edge before routing, so
a path that does not exist answers 401 too. The refusal only means "refused"
when the same url is shown to serve something. Keeping the catalog here, and
having the service modules build their urls from it, is what stops the two
halves drifting onto different routes.
