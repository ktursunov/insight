"""identity-resolution response shapes, hand-written from the Rust DTOs.

Sources, field for field:

    domain/subchart.rs   SubchartNode · SubchartResponse · SubchartForestResponse
    domain/profile.rs    ProfileResponse
    api/roles.rs         RoleResponse
    api/person_roles.rs  PersonRoleResponse
    api/visibility.rs    VisibilityResponse
    api/seed.rs          PersonsSeedOperationResponse
    api/sync.rs          PersonsSyncOperationResponse

**Not generated**, and not from the committed contract — see `schemas/__init__.py`
for why `docs/components/backend/identity-resolution/openapi.json` cannot be
trusted. These models therefore describe OBSERVED behaviour, and `extra` is left
at its default so an added field does not fail the suite. When that contract is
regenerated from the service, this module should be deleted in favour of
generated models with `extra="forbid"`.

Timestamps stay `str`. The service serialises them itself (`api/datetime.rs`
normalises to naive-UTC on the way in), and coercing to `datetime` here would
make the tests assert a parse this suite does not perform — the wire format is
the contract, not Python's reading of it.
