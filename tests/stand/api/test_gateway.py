"""The edge: every operation is refused without a session, actionably.

The rig sweeps 401 over its own 29 analytics operations, and its host verifies
the gateway JWT to answer them. What it still cannot make is the 403 half of
this assertion: with no role gate in front of an in-process service, a refusal
by identity has no way to happen, so 403 sits in its BLOCKED list per route.
Here both are the point — the runtime proof that a deployed stand requires a
real login, and that `authDisabled: true` was never switched on.

Swept over the whole catalogue rather than written per service, because the
property is the gateway's and it is uniform: it terminates the session at the
edge and refuses before it routes anything. One operation added to
`operations.py` is one more url proven closed, with nothing else to remember.

The refusal only MEANS something because the same urls are shown to serve real
data elsewhere in this directory — the gateway answers 401 for paths that do
not exist too.
