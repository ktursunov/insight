"""The identity-resolution service, through the gateway.

Per `deploy/compose/gateway/routes.yaml`, `/api/identity` reaches
`identity-resolution:8082` — the Rust service. The .NET `insight-identity` that
used to answer here was removed upstream in favour of it (epic #1602) and the
gateway was repointed.

Organised by SERVICE, not by auth state, against one path constant per route.
The 401 half is not here: `test_gateway.py` sweeps it over every operation in
`operations.py` at once, since refusing an anonymous caller is the gateway's
uniform behaviour rather than anything identity does. The success cases below
are what make that sweep mean "refused" instead of "there was nothing there" —
the gateway answers 401 for paths that do not exist too.

NOT here: `/v1/persons/{email}`. The committed contract at
`docs/components/backend/identity-resolution/openapi.json` still declares it on
this service, but identity-resolution answers 404 — of the email-keyed lookups
only `/internal/persons/by-email-override` (service principals) is still
served, and login resolves by external id instead; see `test_internal.py`.
The capability itself is not gone: **analytics** serves `/v1/persons/{email}`
and returns 200, so it belongs in an analytics module when one grows to
cover it.

Every PERSON below was logged in by driving the deployed OIDC chain against
Keycloak; no token is minted anywhere in this suite. The one non-person caller
is the service principal in `test_internal.py`, which states how it is issued.
