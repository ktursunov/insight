"""What the suite actually exercised, and whether that is enough.

Two halves, and they never run at the same time.

**Recording** is imported by the suite: `ApiClient.request` calls `record` on
every response, so the ledger is a byproduct of the requests the tests already
make rather than a list somebody maintains. `tests/stand/conftest.py` writes it
out at `pytest_sessionfinish`.

**The gate** (`python3 coverage.py --observed … --spec …`, stdlib only, no
stand) reads that ledger back and answers two questions:

  1. Did every operation the CATALOGUE names get exercised, by something other
     than the anonymous sweep? `api/test_gateway.py` calls all 49 operations
     without a session, so every one has an observation — and a route whose only
     observed code is 401 was swept and never tested. Counting it as covered is
     precisely the mistake this gate exists to prevent.
  2. Did every status code the analytics CONTRACT declares get observed?

Only analytics is gated on its spec. The committed identity document is the
retired .NET contract — it declares only `200` on every operation, lists routes
the service answers 404 for, and omits ones it serves — so gating against it
would demand codes that cannot exist and miss everything real. Identity is held
to (1) instead, which needs no trustworthy document. Same judgement, and for the
same reason, as `Untrusted` in `tests/generate_schemas.py`.

This is a port of `src/ingestion/tests/e2e/lib/api_coverage.py`. The universal
table agrees with it — the rig dropped 401 from its own exclusions once its host
began verifying the gateway JWT, so 429 is all either one drops.

403 is where they still part. The rig blocks it per-route as `.standard_errors`
boilerplate: with no role gate in front of an in-process service, a refusal it
cannot produce cannot be required of it. Here every request crosses a real
gateway carrying a real session, so 403 is reachable and REQUIRED. A gate that
inherited the rig's per-route exclusions would be blind to the authorization
behaviour this suite exists for.

#: Per-operation declared codes this suite cannot reach, with the reason. The

#: can answer (#1669), so without this the gate would demand statuses the API
#: never returns.
#:
#: Self-cleaning: an entry is reported when it becomes observed, when its
#: operation leaves the spec, and when the spec stops declaring the code it
#: subtracts — the last of which is what every #1669 fidelity fix produces.
#:
#: Two codes are subtracted here, each for a reason read out of the service.
#:
#: 403 — analytics has three places that can produce one, and most of its
#: operations reach none of them.
#:
#:   * `domain/person_visibility.rs`  — asking about somebody outside the
#:     caller's visible set. Reached only by `POST /v1/metric-results`.
#:   * `api/admin/error_map.rs::not_tenant_admin_response` — reached by the
#:     admin-threshold surface, but its `is_tenant_admin` is a STUB returning
#:     true for every session ("until the real Auth wiring lands",
#:     `domain/auth.rs`). So the role half is unreachable product-wide, and only
#:     the OTHER trigger fires: a write addressing a row in another tenant.
#:     That is `update` and `delete`, which take an id; `list`, `get_one` and
#:     `create` cannot reach it, and a cross-tenant READ is 404 by opacity
#:     (`threshold_not_found_response`).
#:   * `admin_threshold/lock_enforcer.rs` — `threshold_locked`, on all three
#:     WRITES. `create` reaches it too (service.rs step 8, `check_broader_locks`):
#:     a broader scope's lock shadows a narrower create. Reads do not.
#:
#: Nothing else in the service gates on anything: `is_tenant_admin`,
#: `authorize_*` and `require_admin` appear nowhere in `handlers.rs`,
#: `saved_queries.rs`, `catalog.rs`, `metric_definitions.rs` or
#: `metric_drilldown.rs`. The spec declared 403 on every route anyway, because
#: `.standard_errors` stamped the same seven codes on all of them (#1669); the
#: fidelity fixes are correcting that route by route, and each one that lands
#: retires an entry below.
#:
#: This does NOT retract the module docstring's point. 403 stays out of
#: UNIVERSAL_BOILERPLATE — where a handler HAS the path, this suite is the only
#: one that can prove it, and it does. What is subtracted here is
#: per-route and sourced, which is also how the entries expire: when the real
#: authorization wiring lands, these become observable and the gate says so.

#: 409 is declared on every route and NO route can send one: `already_exists`,

#: the internal-500 alarm instead (#1664), so it is excluded HERE too, tagged
#: with the bug rather than the absence. When #1664 lands, two things say so
